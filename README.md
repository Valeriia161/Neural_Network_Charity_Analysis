# `Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis` <br/>

## `Project Overview ` <br/>
The purpose of Neural_Network_Charity_Analysisis to use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by nonprofit organization Alphabet Soup. <br/>
In this project, I had  access to CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years to help the foundation predict where to make investments. <br/>
#### Resources <br/>
• Data Source: [Google](https://www.google.com/), [AlphabetSoupCharity_starter_code](https://github.com/Valeriia161/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/AlphabetSoupCharity_starter_code.ipynb) , [charity_data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valeriia161/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/main/charity_data.csv) .<br/> 
• Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Git Bash, GitHub, TensorFlow , Machine learning and neural networks. <br/>

# `Result ` <br/>
### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model <br/>
Using knowledge of Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), I preprocessed the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model later in Deliverable 2. <br/>

### Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model <br/>
Using knowledge of TensorFlow, I designed a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. <br/>
